# Bobby Pizza 
- WebApp designed to order some food from the restaurant.
-Technology Used: Servlets
- Functionalities
	-Show Menu Online
	-Sort the Menu items according to category like Pizza or Finger-food etc.
	-Order Food online 
	-Get the Prices on the Browser and Order and Prices on the console.

Vulnerabilities:
- Since this webapp is using ArrayList to store the menu, so, it is  mandatory to 
	invoke addingMenuInList() method from MenuDataService object to add Menu Card
	to the ArrayList. 
- I am not willing to extend the abilities of this application i.e. using
	Databases, because this was just a demo project and making this just for 
	learning purposes. 
Next:
- To make this app better, i will be implementing Databases and some more dynamic web-pages
	 using JSP technology and later Spring Framework. 
	 
This was all for this app. 

Thanks for reading this.
